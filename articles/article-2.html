Do you want well-paid writing jobs? It is easy for content creators to find such jobs on social media, marketplaces, job boards, and online forums. However, most of them don’t know how to verify the legitimacy of a company/client and what types of payment terms should be set. This is because of the lack of negotiation skills. The more work you do and remain friendly with your clients/employers, the better will be your earnings. If you still have problems and think that negotiation is a waste of time, you may apply for a job at magazines/companies that pay a fixed price per post.

<br/><br/>

The good news is that several publications are hiring freelance writers at $200 or more per article. They don’t want you to be experienced. They just want you to be dedicated, honest, reliable, and hardworking. So let’s begin the countdown.

          "link-hover-border-bottom">Shotgun Sports</a></h4>
          <div>Shotgun Sports is a reputed magazine that publishes stories on trapshooting, hunting, and different areas of shot-gunning. If you submit your article to this publisher, make sure its length is 1500 to 2000 words. They don’t want you to pitch a story. Instead, you need to submit a full post. There are five departmental categories: round-ups, interviews, historical posts, test reports, and think pieces. If your post is accepted, you will be paid up to $200 upon publication. In the beginning, they may pay $50 to $100, and once the trust is built, your pay per article may get increased.</div>

          "link-hover-border-bottom">Guideposts</a></h4>
          <div>
            Guideposts is suitable for creative-minded freelance writers. They want true, fact-based articles about people who have attained certain goals and are famous in their respective fields. The stories must be written in the first person and should provide the reader with enough knowledge. Every reader should be able to apply this information/knowledge to their own life. You can write your own story or can talk about another person who has become an inspiration in one way or the other. The ideal length of an article is 1500 words, and if your work is liked by the editor, you will be paid $250. Please remember that they don’t want fiction, sermons, or essays. Besides, they never publish poetry and don’t evaluate too long pieces.

          "link-hover-border-bottom">The War Cry</a></h4>
          <div>The War Cry is owned and managed by the Salvation Army. They have been around for over a century and want articles on homelessness, poverty, old-age people, addiction, apprenticeship, modern slavery, influencing social policy, isolation, debt advice, and unemployment. Make sure your post has at least 1000 words. If they like your work, they will get back to you and may offer $200 to $300. I have heard that they pay $350 a post to their most experienced, skilled, and reliable content creators. So this is your chance to win their trust to be able to make hundreds of dollars for every story you write. If you have some concerns, feedback, or questions, I suggest you check the official website and contact support.</div>
